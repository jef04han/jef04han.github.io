Tried to make my own portfolio webpage in a rush
# Personal Portfolio

This is the source code repository for my Personal Portfolio page hosted using `Github Pages`. It only contains the Landing Page for now and the other Pages Navbar is a WIP. It uses `animate.css` and `particles.js` to make it better UI wise. Feel free to give it a star if you like it :)
